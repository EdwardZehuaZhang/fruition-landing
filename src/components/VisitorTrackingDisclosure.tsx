      <p className={p}>
        We use a B2B visitor identification service (
        <strong className={strong}>RB2B</strong>, operated by Retention.com) to
        recognise business visitors to this website. RB2B matches anonymised
        device signals against publicly available business contact data so we
        can understand who is researching our services and follow up where
        appropriate. This service applies to visitors from every region we
        operate in, including the United States, the United Kingdom, the
        European Economic Area, and the rest of the world.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3}>What we collect about you</h3>
      <ul className={ul}>
        <li className="leading-relaxed">
          <strong className={strong}>Business identity</strong>: first name,
          last name, job title, business email, LinkedIn URL, and the employer
          associated with you in business directories.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-relaxed">
          <strong className={strong}>Company firmographics</strong>: company
          name, public website, industry, headcount range, estimated revenue,
          and approximate location (city, state/region, country).
        </li>
        <li className="leading-relaxed">
          <strong className={strong}>Visit context</strong>: the pages you
          viewed on this site, the referring URL (if any), and the timestamp of
          your visits. Repeat visits update existing records rather than
          creating duplicates.
        </li>
        <li className="leading-relaxed">
          <strong className={strong}>Company-only identification</strong>:
          where we can identify the company but not a specific individual, we
          record only the company and visit context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p className={p}>
        We do <strong className={strong}>not</strong> collect payment data,
        government identifiers, health information, or anything you have not
        published in a business context. RB2B does not place tracking cookies on
        your device; it relies on its own data graph.
      </p>

      <h3 className={h3}>Why we use it</h3>
      <p className={p}>
        We rely on our <strong className={strong}>legitimate interests</strong>{" "}
