    answer:
      "Yes. Fruition is a monday.com Platinum Partner and won the Rising Star Award at the 2026 monday.com Partner Summit. Our founder spent six years at monday.com before starting Fruition, so we know the platform from the inside.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms and AI tools do you work with?",
    answer:
      "monday.com, Atlassian (Jira, Jira Service Management, Confluence) and HubSpot, plus AI implementation across Anthropic Claude, OpenAI and Microsoft Copilot, with automation on n8n and native platform integrations.",
  },

    question: "How much does a monday.com implementation cost?",

  {
    question: "Can you migrate us from another tool?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We regularly migrate teams from Smartsheet, Asana, Trello, Wrike, SimPro and spreadsheets (including data, automations and integrations) with training and change management so the new platform actually gets adopted.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Fruition different from other partners?",
    answer:
      "Process before platform: we design how your business should run first, then configure the tool to match. Combined with insider platform experience and in-house AI capability, implementations land faster and stick.",
  },
