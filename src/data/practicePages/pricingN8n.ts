/**
 * /pricing — copy ported from the approved v2.1 mockups (pricing.html).
 * (The /ai-consulting/n8n page was pruned July 2026 — 301 →
 * /partnerships/n8n-integration-partner.)
 *
 * Notes on the port:
 * - The immutable `services` card type carries no href, so the cross-links the
 *   mockups imply are surfaced through the `children` (linked) section instead,
 *   pointing only at real routes.
 * - The mockups credited "Josh Roszler"; the leader bio is a shared constant
 *   (PRACTICE_LEADER, already corrected to Jebathilak) and is not re-stated here.
 * - Pricing FAQ #3 read "How much does consulting consulting cost" in the mockup
 *   — a doubled-word artifact, de-duplicated to "consulting" here.
