/**
 * Proof cluster — the /certifications-and-awards page. (The /case-studies hub
 * was retired July 2026 — 301 → /customer-testimonials, the ranked library.)
 * Copy ported verbatim from the v2.1 mockups (resources/case-studies.html +
 * partners.html). The mockups credited "Josh Roszler"; the leader bio is a
 * shared constant (PRACTICE_LEADER) already corrected to Jebathilak, so no
 * ported field here names him.
 *
 * Both mockups render two card blocks — a numbered block (→ approach) and a
 * non-link spec block (→ services); neither wraps its cards in links. The
 * case-studies hub keeps them unlinked (its Featured stories already render as
 * the numbered approach section). The certifications page adds a curated
 * `children` directory linking each credential to its real /partnerships/*
 * page, as the brief requires — Twilio and Zapier are omitted (no route yet).

      },
      {
        q: 'Does being a partner bias Fruition’s recommendations?',
