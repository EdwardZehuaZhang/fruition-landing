/**
 * Long-form copy for the industry landing pages, lifted from the Fruition blog
 * archive and re-cut for the page.
 *
 * Construction, real estate, professional services and manufacturing came from
 * the content team's Aug 2026 handover. The FAQ half of that handover already
 * lives in Sanity as `faqItem` docs / page `faqTabs`; only the sections marked
 * "Use as H2" are here, because they needed section designs that did not exist
 * yet. Retail, marketing and government were then mined from the same blog
 * archive so every industry landing page carries the treatment:
 *   - retail      → monday-com-for-retail
 *   - marketing   → top-marketing-challenges, 5-mondaycom-features-for-marketing-teams
 *   - government  → mondaycom-enterprise-permissions (Enterprise-plan controls)
 *
 * Every string may carry the inline-markdown subset `<RichText>` renders —
 * `**bold**` and `[text](/relative/path)`. Blog links are the current slugs,
 * not the Wix-era ones the source documents were written against.
