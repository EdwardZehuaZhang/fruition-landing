 *  - No invented CSAT/review scores — the real review figures live on the
 *    testimonials page and are not restated as headline stats.
 *  - Regional detail is factual context (time zones, privacy law, local
 *    accounting stacks), never a claim of certification under those regimes.
 *  - Spelling follows the market: -ise/-isation for AU/UK/SG/IN/PH, -ize for US.
