 * What the portal shows when a URL under /internal doesn't resolve.

 * Without this, an unmatched portal URL fell through to the marketing site's
 * 404 — which, to a signed-out colleague opening a link to a portal page, is
 * indistinguishable from the page being gone. So sign-in comes first: if
 * there's no session, this IS the login screen, because "you're not signed in"
 * is nearly always the real reason. Only a signed-in person, who genuinely can
 * see the portal, is told the page doesn't exist.
