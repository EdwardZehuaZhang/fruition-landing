/**
 * Moves a lead to "Meeting Booked" when the visitor completes the booking
 * inside our embedded Calendly.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than relying on the invitee.created webhook: the
 * subscription is scope=user and belongs to the shared global-calendar account,
 * so it only fires for bookings on *that* calendar. Every booking in this flow
 * lands on a consultant's own Calendly account, which the webhook never sees —
 * the lead would sit in New Leads forever. An organization-scoped subscription
 * would cover all of them, but creating one needs a Calendly admin or owner
 * (this token is role `user` and gets 403), so it can't be done from here.
 *
 * The browser tells us instead: Calendly's embed emits a `calendly.event_scheduled`
 * postMessage on completion, and the client relays it here.
 *
 * Trust model: this request is unauthenticated and its claim is unverifiable —
 * reading the invitee back from Calendly needs access to the consultant's
 * account, which this token doesn't have. So it is deliberately limited to
 * advancing the status of a lead that already exists, and cannot create one.
 * The blast radius of a forged call is a lead marked "Meeting Booked" early;
 * no data is exposed and nothing is created. The webhook remains the
 * authoritative path once an admin can scope it to the organization — and it is
 * idempotent with this one, since both promote the same item.
