/**
 * Records a consultation enquiry *before* the visitor picks a slot, then hands
 * back the regional consultant's Calendly link with their details prefilled.
 *
 * The ordering is the point. With Calendly's embed alone a lead only exists if
 * the visitor completes a booking — everyone who opens the calendar and leaves
 * is invisible. Capturing here means the CRM sees every enquiry, and the
 * invitee.created webhook later promotes the ones that convert to
 * "Meeting Booked" (see promoteLeadToBooked) rather than creating a duplicate.
 *
 * Routing to a real person's calendar is the other half: the shared
 * global-calendar account showed availability that belonged to nobody.
