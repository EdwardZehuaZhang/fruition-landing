/**
 * Drop the cached copies of every page a blog post appears on.
 *
 * The site runs on OpenNext/Workers with a persistent ISR cache in KV
 * (open-next.config.ts), so a rendered page survives isolate restarts and
 * even the `revalidate = 3600` window is only honoured when something asks
 * for a re-render. `revalidatePath` is what asks — it writes the path's tag
 * to the D1 tag cache (NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1), and the next request to that path
 * misses the cache and re-renders from Sanity.
 *
 * Without the tag cache binding this is a silent no-op, which is exactly why
 * updating a published post used to change Sanity but never the live site.
 *
 * Never let a cache miss fail a publish: the write to Sanity has already
 * happened by the time this runs, so failures are collected and reported back
 * as a warning rather than thrown.
