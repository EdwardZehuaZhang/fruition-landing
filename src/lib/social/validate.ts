/**
 * Publishability rules for a single social post, in one place.

 * (so the blockers are live, not one save behind), and every publish/schedule
 * route runs the same function server-side before touching Zernio. Keeping the
 * rules here rather than in zernio.ts also keeps that module byte-identical to
 * its marketa-monorepo mirror, and keeps account ids out of the client bundle.
