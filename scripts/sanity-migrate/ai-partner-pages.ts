    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What is an Anthropic Claude expert consulting partner?', answer: "An Anthropic Claude expert consulting partner is a vetted services firm that designs, implements and operates production deployments of Anthropic's Claude models — including the Claude API, Claude Code and agentic systems built on Model Context Protocol — for enterprise clients. Fruition is one of a small group of such firms operating across APAC, the UK and the US." },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you support Claude deployments in Australia and APAC?', answer: 'Yes. Fruition is headquartered in Sydney and delivers Claude implementations across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and India with local data residency guidance and compliance review aligned to the Australian Privacy Principles, Singapore PDPA and India DPDP.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Can you implement Claude Code across an engineering team?', answer: 'Yes. We run Claude Code pilots, write tailored CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md files for your codebase, configure MCP servers for your internal tooling, and measure developer productivity gains over a 30–60 day rollout. We typically benchmark before-and-after on time-to-merge, defect rates and review cycles.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What industries do you focus on?', answer: 'Professional services, financial services, retail and FMCG, hospitality, sport, government and not-for-profit. Prior client engagements include Sekisui House, JB Hi-Fi NZ, News Corp Australia, CSIRO, Bureau Veritas and Patties Food Group.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'How much does a Claude enterprise deployment cost?', answer: 'Discovery engagements are fixed price from AUD $15,000. Pilots typically run AUD $25,000–$65,000. Full agentic system builds range from AUD $80,000 upward depending on integration surface and ongoing model usage. We scope fixed-price phases rather than open-ended time-and-materials.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'How is Claude different from ChatGPT for enterprise use?', answer: 'Claude is built around Constitutional AI principles, has industry-leading long-context performance, excels at tool use and structured outputs, and offers a transparent safety posture — making it the model of choice for regulated, brand-sensitive and high-complexity enterprise workflows. ChatGPT remains a strong product; the right choice depends on use case, integrations and procurement realities, and we advise objectively on both.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you write the prompts and skills for our team?', answer: 'Yes — and we teach your team to write them. Our deliverables include production prompt libraries, evaluation harnesses, SKILL.md files and prompt engineering playbooks tailored to your domain and tone of voice.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Are you a reseller of Anthropic Claude?', answer: 'No. We are an implementation and consulting partner. We can advise on commercial procurement of Claude through Anthropic, AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, but our value is delivery and enablement — not reselling tokens.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Where is your team based?', answer: 'Sydney (headquarters), London and New York, with delivery support from Manila, Bangalore and Bangkok. Our model is local accountability with global delivery economics.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Can Claude be deployed in regulated industries?', answer: 'Yes. Claude is available with enterprise controls via Anthropic directly, AWS Bedrock and Google Vertex AI — supporting data residency, zero-retention configurations and HIPAA-ready deployments. We help select and configure the right deployment path for your regulatory posture.' },

    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What is an OpenAI ChatGPT expert consulting partner?', answer: 'An OpenAI ChatGPT expert consulting partner is an external firm that helps enterprises deploy ChatGPT Enterprise, build custom GPTs, integrate the OpenAI Assistants and Responses APIs, and fine-tune models on private data — covering strategy, build, change management and operations.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you roll out ChatGPT Enterprise in Australia and APAC?', answer: 'Yes. Fruition is headquartered in Sydney and delivers ChatGPT Enterprise and ChatGPT Team rollouts across Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and India, including identity provider configuration, SCIM provisioning, governance and adoption programs.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Can you build custom GPTs for our business?', answer: 'Yes. We design, build and maintain custom GPTs with private knowledge bases, secure Actions calling internal APIs, role-scoped access and usage analytics. Typical build is two to six weeks per GPT depending on integration depth.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you integrate the OpenAI Assistants and Responses APIs?', answer: 'Yes. We build production systems on the OpenAI Assistants API, the Responses API and function calling, including retrieval, code interpreter, file search and custom tool integrations to systems like Salesforce, monday.com, Snowflake and HubSpot.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Should we use ChatGPT or the OpenAI API?', answer: 'Most enterprises run both. ChatGPT Enterprise is the every-employee productivity surface; the OpenAI API is for embedded AI in products and workflows. We help draw the line and govern both deployments.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What does a ChatGPT Enterprise rollout cost?', answer: "Fruition's services for a typical 100–500 seat ChatGPT Enterprise rollout range from AUD $35,000 to $120,000 over 6–12 weeks, separate from OpenAI licensing. Custom GPT and Assistants API builds are scoped fixed-price per use case." },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Can you fine-tune OpenAI models on our data?', answer: 'Yes. We run fine-tuning programs on GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 and selected o-series models, including data curation, evaluation harnesses and ongoing model lifecycle management.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'How do you handle data privacy?', answer: 'ChatGPT Enterprise and the OpenAI API offer zero-data-retention configurations and SOC 2 compliance. We design deployments aligned to Australian Privacy Principles, UK GDPR and applicable US frameworks (HIPAA, FedRAMP-aware) where required.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Are you an OpenAI reseller?', answer: 'No. We are a services partner. We advise on procurement of ChatGPT Enterprise, Team and API credits — but our deliverables are implementation, integration and enablement, not licence resale.' },

Fruition is one of a small group of such firms operating across APAC, the UK and the US.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What is an autonomous AI agent?', answer: 'An autonomous AI agent is a software system that uses an LLM to perceive a task, plan a sequence of steps, call tools or APIs, observe the results, and iterate until the task is complete — without per-step human direction. Agents differ from chatbots in that they take actions, not just generate text.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you deploy agents in regulated industries?', answer: 'Yes. Our agent deployments include audit logging, action-level approval gates, sandboxed execution and rollback paths. We design agents for regulated sectors including financial services and healthcare-adjacent workflows, with regulator-aware governance baked into the architecture.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Which model providers do you work with?', answer: 'We are model-agnostic. We work with Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-5 series, Google Gemini, and open-weight models including Llama and Qwen — selecting the best fit per agent role. Most production agents we build use multiple models across different tasks.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'How is agentic AI different from ChatGPT?', answer: 'A chatbot like ChatGPT generates a response to a single prompt. An agent decides what to do across many steps, uses tools (APIs, databases, browsers, code execution), and completes multi-stage tasks. Agentic AI is what makes AI take action in your systems rather than just answer questions about them.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'What does an autonomous agent build cost?', answer: 'A first agent in production typically ranges from AUD $45,000 to $120,000 depending on integration surface and risk profile. Multi-agent systems start at AUD $150,000. Discovery engagements are fixed-price from AUD $15,000 and produce a costed implementation plan.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you build on Model Context Protocol?', answer: 'Yes. MCP is a primary integration layer for our agents — we build custom MCP servers exposing internal tools and data, and integrate published MCP servers for systems including monday.com, GitHub, Slack and Google Workspace.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Can agents take destructive actions safely?', answer: 'Yes — when architected correctly. We design action gating, two-step confirmation for irreversible operations, scoped credentials, sandboxed execution and full audit trails. Risk-tiered actions get human-in-the-loop approval; low-risk actions run unattended.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Where is your team based?', answer: 'Sydney (headquarters), London and New York, with engineering delivery from Manila, Bangalore and Bangkok.' },
    { _type: 'aiFaq', question: 'Do you operate agents after launch?', answer: 'Yes. We run a managed operations service covering observability, drift detection, prompt regression testing, model upgrades and continuous evaluation — keeping agents performant as models and your business evolve.' },
